  report:
    - "&7Thank you for reporting &#F4C4F3%player%&7. Your report has been submitted."
    - "&cRemember that reporting someone randomly may result in a ban."
  broadcast:
    - "&7[&c&lREP&r&7] &c%player% has been reported for %type%: &r%reason%"
  reload: "&aConfiguration reloaded successfully."

  last-report:
    server:
      - "&7The last report sent by a player is:"
      - "&7Target: &#F4C4F3%target%"
      - "&7Type: &#F4C4F3%type%"
      - "&7Reason: &#F4C4F3%reason%"

      - "&7Type: &#F4C4F3%type%"
      - "&7Reason: &#F4C4F3%reason%"
      - "&7Time: &#F4C4F3%time%"

  reason: "&cYou must specify a reason to report."
  type: "&cInvalid report type. Valid types are: cheating, exploiting, harassment, other."
```

### Some strings are in lists so that multiple messages can be added or removed if necessary or desired without forking the plugin.

*All the configs support hex codes with the prefix & and basic Minecraft colour codes.*
*Placeholders ONLY work if used by the plugin's default config.yml.*

## Changing the Discord Webhook

To send report notifications to a different Discord channel, simply update the `settings.webhook` URL in `config.yml` line 25.

```yaml
webhook: "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your-webhook-url"
```

## Changing the storage configs

### Disable the storage or re-enable

To disabile the storage, simply update the `settings.storage.enabled` boolean in `config.yml` line 28. 

```yaml
    enabled: true
```

### File name & Path
To change the file path & name, simply update the `settings.storage.file` name in `config.yml` line 29. 
*To add or change directory just write the directory name and add a "/"*

```yaml
    file: "plugins/Reports/reports.yml"
```

Save the file and **reload or restart your server**. Your plugin will now send reports to the new webhook.
